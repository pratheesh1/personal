An attempt at practicing more leetcode questions. Using help from this [repository](https://github.com/Bishalsarang/Leetcode-Questions-Scraper) instead of the official leetcode website.

## Project Structure

- directory name: name of the question in `snake_case`
- the actual question: `question.md`

- tests: if adding tests in separate files that is in corresponding `tests.xx` file (e.g. `tests.ts`, `tests.rs`, `tests.c`)

## Attempted Questions:

| Question Number | Name    | Comments |
