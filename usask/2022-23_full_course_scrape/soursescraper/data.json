It offers an advanced overview of the concepts, theories and implications arising from debates generated through eco-feminisms, as they intersect with the socially constructed geographies of local and global environments. How might sustainable or even post-development approaches to the flourishing of local and planetary bio-diversities, draw on intersectional gender-based ecological inquiry and feminist place-centered critiques? How might scholars and activists begin to imagine practical environmental justice? How do current models of work, consumption and the variously mediated strategies informing political ecology enable or disable gender-sensitive socio-ecological and feminist geographical research?",

The course is intended for students with little to no previous University-level writing experience, but who have an intense interest in theatre. The specific dramaturgical approach employed in the course focuses on the actor/character relationship to text, where the actor is always the first audience of any script. In that the actor is ultimately responsible for interpreting the text (through performance to the audience), it is the playwright's goal to create a script that both challenges and engages the actor. The craft of writing plays is explored through exercises and class discussion, and the course focuses on First Nations and Métis cultural concerns.",

What is the ritual and how can ritual analysis help us to enter the domain of Ukrainian culture? Is ritual only about traditional Ukrainian weddings, Christmas and Easter celebrations, or can such events as Taras Shevchenko’s reburial, the Orange and Euromaidan Revolutions of 2004 and 2013, and recent political events in Ukraine be studied similarly, as well? And why ritual? How can ritual account for the dynamic nature of ethnic or nation building processes? What can it teach us about ourselves, our history, our culture? These and other questions will be addressed in class.",

    "Description": "This course will examine the politics and social reproduction of work in Canada. It will begin by examining how working people have responded to workplace conditions, beginning in the 19th century and moving to the present day. Here we will examine work broadly, focusing on how both paid and unpaid labour is shaped by class, gender, race and other forms of social inequity. The course will then look at how governments regulate work in the 21st century, examining how employment is structured as a strict legal relationship between those who sell their labour for a wage and those who purchase that labour in order to create additional value through profit. Examining these intersections, the class will then examine the numerous legal structures that shape the modern workplace, focusing on rules of unionization, individual employment relations, and occupational health and safety.",

    "Department": "Political Studies",
    "Description": "This course critically examines the needs of a community in the aftermath of conflict and explores various approaches to peace-building and justice as attempted in northern Uganda. Uganda has struggled, and continues to struggle, with difficult decisions about how to address legacies of violence and human rights violations. For two decades (1986-2006), northern Uganda was the site of fear and violence as the rebel group ‘the Lord’s Resistance Army’ terrorized communities with brutality and kidnapping, creating and maintaining a force of attacking child soldiers. Also accused of atrocity is the government and its army, the UPDF. Uganda came into the spotlight as local and international human rights practitioners debated peace-vs-justice, especially with regards to the imposition of international criminal justice (the first indictments from the International Criminal Court in 2005; first and only conviction happened in March 2021) and the abilities of traditional mechanisms of justice to address mass atrocity and promote reconciliation. There have also been questions about the need or usefulness of a truth and reconciliation commission or possibly the need for vetting in the Ugandan UPDF, (among the options of mechanisms to pursue justice and reconciliation). This study abroad course explores practical questions of transitional justice using Uganda as a case study.",

However, despite there being no overarching authority, international actors have developed international organizations, laws, and norms to provide rules and structures to manage transnational relations and contribute to the solutions for problems of global scope. While some view international organizations and law as simply a means by which powerful states pursue their own interests, others argue that international law has power beyond politics and can rein in self-interest and provide the means and methods for cooperation, coordination, and respect for human rights. This course introduces students to the history, design, and contemporary operations of some of the legal structures underpinning international relations, such as the United Nations, the International Court of Justice, and the International Criminal Court, and explores how politics and law interact in shaping contemporary international relations and the lives of individuals globally.",

In fact, leadership competency statements appear in at least 5 of the 7 domains of MPH competencies (Community Health Nurses of Canada [CHNC], 2015). The course has three (3) modules: In module 1, students will be introduced to basic knowledge on leadership (definitions, theories, styles). Subsequently, unique aspects of leadership in public health that distinguishes it from generic/business leadership will be explored. In module 2, students will be introduced to LEADS (Lead self, Engage others, Achieve results, Develop coalitions, Systems transformation). It was recently established that most of the competencies in public health leadership mapped well with “LEADS in a caring environment” leadership framework\n(CHNC, 2015). LEADS is a well-established framework for leadership development in Canada, and “embodies key skills, behaviors, abilities and knowledge required to lead in all sectors of the economy and types of organizations” (LEADScanada.ca). Finally, in module 3, the leadership competencies specific for public health practice in Canada will be addressed.

From the early twentieth century up until the present era of the global War on Terrorism, Hollywood has manufactured images of Islam that have been closely intertwined with the dynamics of political and economic interests and ideological motives to dominate Other. Through lectures, discussion, and the screening of selected movies – from the classic Lawrence of Arabia (1962) to post 9/11 films such as The Kingdom (2007) – we will closely analyze what has changed in the representations of Islam, what persists, and why. This course is not an entirely movie-based review and analysis. However, in order to present the images of Hollywood’s Islam in the lectures and discussion, the screening of selected movies is inevitable. This course will be divided into three themes: classical Oriental depictions of Islam (which portrayed Muslims as exotic, sensual, and irrational); national security concerns, from the post-1979 Iranian revolution to the Gulf War, and; the global War on Terrorism after 9/11.",

Various areas of insolvency law will be discussed including one of the newest issues, the treatment of encrypted digital currencies (“cryptocurrencies” or the “bitcoin”) when a debtor becomes insolvent. Other issues that will be explored include debtor-in-possession financing, critical suppliers, mass tort claims (ie. the Red Cross tainted blood scandal), cross-border insolvencies of multinational corporations, how a debtor’s environmental damage is dealt with in insolvency, the treatment of intellectual property, employment law as well as the use of the CCAA and Chapter 11 to liquidate companies rather than reorganize. The recent reorganizations of Target, Sears and Toys ‘R’ Us will also be examined."

The course concentrates on its expression in Africa and India, with occasional examples drawn from the Caribbean and elsewhere. It focuses on general discussions of the civilizing mission then explores these arguments in more detail through an examination of specific elements of the ways colonial regimes attempted to alter the behaviour of the colonized and through examinations of how the colonizers came to believe they understood the colonized.",

We’ll analyze his military conquests and his cultural impact (including the role that women played in facilitating his rise to power and his attempts to merge Macedonian and Persian culture), as well as how fictionalized versions of Alexander’s life shaped views about him across Europe and the Middle East for over a thousand years.",

The course focuses on Indigenous experiences in Canadian cities to better understand Indigenous experiences in prairie cities, specifically Saskatoon. Course themes include: the manifestation of “urban” or “municipal colonialism” as a key element of the colonial project; the erasure of Indigenous peoples from urban spaces; gendered and racialized colonial violence in urban spaces; the development of urban Indigenous social and political organizations; and, cities as Indigenous gathering spaces and places of resilience and resistance where Indigenous peoples continue to make space for themselves and their relations.",

    "Department": "History",
    "Description": "The city of Rome evokes visions of conquest and empire, and of emperors and dictators. Augustus, establishing himself as Rome’s first emperor after decades of civil war, transformed Rome from ‘a city of brick to one of marble,’ imprinting the ideology of his rule, and of the eternity of empire in architecture. Two millennia later, in the 20th century, Benito Mussolini became il Duce, the founder of fascism, and Italy’s leader. Like Augustus, Mussolini stressed the need for the rebirth of the Italian nation after a long period of disunity and warfare. This entailed the creation of “new Italians” and the foundation of a “new Italy” of which Rome once again would be the symbolic centre, an embodiment of the glorious Roman imperial past, and of the glorious fascist present and future. Thus, the Rome of the emperors and the Rome of fascism are intimately linked. In this course we examine how Augustus and his successors, through architecture and other urban interventions, made Rome into the “Imperial city” par excellence, one that reflected their absolutist rule. At the same time we explore how Mussolini often appropriated (and sometimes destroyed) this ancient architectural heritage to create a city that reflected the socio-political ideals of Fascism. In this course, students will experience ancient and Fascist Rome in person, and will come to see how these two political systems used architecture, monuments and urban space as socio-political tools aimed at shaping their societies.",

We examine how historians have contributed to popular understandings of drugs, alcohol, and intoxication and we consider what role social sciences and humanities scholars play in shaping our popular understandings of what makes good drugs and bad drugs, or how scholars and policy makers have determined limits for acceptable intoxicating behaviours and who has the privilege to be intoxicated, or who is criminalized for seeking intoxication. Rather than follow a chronological structure, in this course we examine how different psychoactive substances have been viewed in different places, from the perspectives of colonizers and colonized at different time points in history."

Built upon the institutions of early Christian Europe and the remnants of classical civilization, the high and late Middle Ages produced many of the social, cultural, intellectual, religious, legal, and political institutions that still operate in Europe and the European diaspora today. Investigation of the medieval period is thus interdisciplinary and requires flexible approaches to a wide range of written and material sources.

In doing so, we will study inter-tribal borderlands, borderlands between Natives and newcomers, and the creation of borders between European powers. We will assess the impact and contributions that communities such as the Cree, Sioux, Nez Perce, Métis, Comanche, Iroquois and Coast Salish made to the demarcation, enforcement, and placement of European boundaries. Finally, we will compare the borderlands of North America to borderlands across the world, utilizing case studies from Europe, Thailand, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, and Morocco.

Food, its production, marketing, preparation and consumption is the product of particular societies and cultural practices and, ultimately, food has a history. Drawing upon the recent international and national literature this class offers a social and cultural history of Canada through food. Employing the traditional analytical categories of social history (race, gender, class and nation/region) provides us with the tools to understand the expansion of food products and commercialization; the growth of fast food empires; immigration and \"ethnic\" cuisine, the gendered dynamics of the kitchen, the farmyard and the grocery store; food safety and social justice; and now, most recently, our fascination with sustainability, organic foods and so-called '100 mile diets.'",

The film appears to confirm that the Romans, especially emperors and the plebeian masses, were a cruel and bloodthirsty lot. Trained killers- gladiators- slaughtered innocent victims, or savage lions mauled and devoured them, all for the pleasure of the Roman people. This course takes a critical look at the varied deadly activities (munera, venationes, damnatio ad bestias), held in the Roman arena by examining ancient textual and visual sources, and modern scholarship. We will examine these spectacles in the broader context of Roman performance culture, religion and politics. Were these spectacles merely the product of a debased and declining culture? How has modern scholarship understood the apparent madness of the Roman arena?",

We will also consider Buddhism in modern Asia and in the west. Class meetings will combine lectures that provide historical and cultural context with discussions—and films—to clarify and interpret the assigned readings. Readings center on primary materials in English translation rather than on secondary scholarship so that students will define Buddhism on their own terms. Several questions guide this class: How has the world been imagined and experienced by Buddhists over time and over different geographies and cultures? What aspects of Buddhism are Westerners eager to see and what are they not interested in?",

This class will engage with all these issues and we will try to find answers. This class consciously left out National Socialism, as the goal is to think about all those other Fascist and Fascist-like systems, parties, and groups which are often put aside and ignored.

But not everyone agreed with Herodotus’ approach. Most strikingly, his immediate successor, Thucydides, emphatically rejected his methodology and proposed an alternative. And subsequent writers regularly proposed alternative viewpoints regarding best approach to writing history. This course will trace the development of historical writing in the ancient world and explore the different approaches that Greek and Roman historians brought to the discipline by analyzing a variety of primary sources (in translation). In the process, we’ll explore questions about the purpose and methodology of history more broadly, including about how we practice it today.",

Stemming from the dismantling of colonial empires and the creation of an infrastructure to manage the international economy near the end of Second World War, 'development' promised to end or dramatically reduce poverty around the world. Development policies ultimately failed to meet those goals and were replaced by neo- liberalism and arguments about good governance by the end of the 20th century. This course explores the idea of development and suggests the difficulties encountered in living up to its promises lie in its basic premises; reliant as they are on the continued desire to impose specific types of economic and social relations around the world---the continuation of what might be called the Menace of Progress. The course explores this history through an examination of post-independent economic policy in Africa, Asia and Latin America and an exploration of the history behind various ideas important to the concept of development: poverty, population and the expanded role of the market.",

How has the meaning of human rights changed over time? Finally, how does the CMHR present the history of human rights (or their violation), and in what ways do the museum’s choices influence the public’s understanding of that history? By engaging our senses as well as our critical faculties, the encounter with the museum will heighten our interest in the subject and facilitate transformative learning.",

The course also looks at the social, cultural and religious beliefs of African people and later investigate the development of new pluralistic societies which integrated newcomers and local people into global trading networks. We then consider one of the central debates of Southern African history, the Mfecane: the period in which Shaka waged wars across the Southern African interior and the “empty land myth”.

This course will show that Africa and Africans played a central role in global history. This course begins with a consideration of the process of colonization, how colonists carved up Africa with very little consideration for the people or geography. This process fundamentally shaped the political, social and economic developments during this era. We will then look at the major migration from the rural to the urban areas in the mid-20th Century and how this shaped the capitalist economy. Finally the course looks at the liberation and post-liberation period, considering the experiences of soldiers, exiles and refugees. In the final weeks, we will look at the creation of the African Diaspora and the processes of ‘development’ which have seen a renewed interest in Africa. We will ask to what extent this new interest might be considered neo-colonialism.",

The Russian tradition, from Peter I to Nicholas II, has become a hotly debated field of current political discourse both in Russia and in the West. A central question is whether the Russian tradition was a historical dead end, or a promise cut short by revolutionary violence? In considering this question, topics involving politics, social history, culture, gender, religion, and ethnicity will be discussed.",

    "Description": "Was there an Industrial Revolution? This seems like an odd question given the importance of industrialization in the modern world, but when historians searched the evidence many concluded the Industrial Revolution was “neither very industrial nor very revolutionary”. We’ll work to understand why industrialization started in Britain and debate whether it needs to be renamed. We will then explore the economic, social, political and environmental consequences of industrialization in England, Scotland and Wales; including how urbanization and industrialization changed social and gender relations, creating new demands for democratic reform, unionization and women's rights. We will look at the global history of industrialization, from the cotton plantations, wheat fields, sheep stations, palm groves and copper mines that supplied raw materials to British factories, to the spread of industrial economies to Germany, North America, Japan and China. While exploring these interconnected histories, we will learn about different methods and approaches to history such as economic, social, political and environmental history. The history of the first modern industrial society; urbanization, democratization and class conflict; the rise of the labour movement, the triumph of middle-class values, the decline of the aristocracy; the changing religious and moral climate; the domestic consequences of world power; the social and economic impact of two world wars, the loss of world power.",

    "Description": "Western Christendom, once unified under a single church, was fractured permanently in the sixteenth century giving rise to religious wars and the widespread action against heresy. In the same period, the earth centred model of the universe was demonstrated to be false and new scientific epistemologies emerged. Seemingly in contradiction to these scientific developments, this was also the main period of witch trials. While Europe remained profoundly misogynist and hetero-normative, we also find startling cases of feminist ideas, radical gender expression, and queer sexualities. Focussing on original texts, this course explores the relationship of tradition and dissent, rebellion and authority in this tumultuous period.",

Many were martyrs and miracle workers, but we also find holy madmen, transvestites, prostitutes. In this class we explore the diverse representations of sanctity in the hagiographical tradition of the Middle Ages, addressing both the literary and the historical questions raised therein. We ask how Christian communities in the later Roman Empire conceived of sanctity. We address questions of gender and empire, ritual and the body, memory and the use of the past. We explore the array of evidence for the cult of the saints—both literary and material—first in an attempt to understand the complex of practices and beliefs that accompany its emergence, but also to recognize more broadly what this institution can tell us about the Mediterranean world of late antiquity and Medieval Europe.",

We will then turn to examine the effects of empire on the ruled, both in Rome and in the provinces, focusing on issues such Roman military and administrative presence in the provinces, economic exploitation, and the diffusion of Roman style spectacles and religious cult.",

Some of the questions we will ask include: Where can we find connections or discontinuities? How can – and cannot – textual and archaeological sources help us understand people and their daily lives? How have Chinese thinkers, leaders, religious professionals, and ordinary people understood the past and used it to address pressing concerns even today?

Two overarching questions will shape our investigation:  what internal and external factors allowed Rome to extend its empire first over Italy and then over the Mediterranean basin? Why did the government of Rome by the SPQR - the senate and people of Rome - the system called the Republic- ultimately fail and fall to civil war and a monarchy established by Julius Caesar and his successors? Seeking answers to these questions will entail the exploration not only of events and actors in Roman history but also the underlying political and social factors that shaped Rome: Rome’s political system; its ideas about family; aristocratic competition;  economy, agriculture and slavery; the roman army and society; the city of Rome and urban violence; the nature of Roman imperialism.",

We'll also examine how animals were cared for, from animal husbandry to the beginnings of veterinary medicine. We'll analyze the myriad roles that animals played in classical literature to shed light on expectations and ideals for human life. We’ll see that some viewed them as mere tools for human use, while others viewed them as rational, moral beings deserving of just treatment. Ultimately, we'll see that it is only by examining society’s relationship with animals that we can understand the human experience in the Greco-Roman world.",

All sections of this course are linked through their exploration of the history of identities and communities but they explore that history in different places and times. Some courses will take a micro-level view, exploring the history of identity in one particular location or community over time and relating those changes to broader perspectives; others will look at the way broad historical forces shaped identities. Possible areas of exploration may include: historical roots and myths surrounding so called \"tribalism\" in Africa and the contemporary impacts of this discourse; the spread nationalism in the 18th and 19th centuries and the rise of the modern nation-state; how such groups as Kurds have been able to maintain a distinct identity over time; Quebec’s status as a separate ‘nation’ in Canada.",

The situation of an artistic gesture is the subject of this inquiry. Who does an artwork call on to secure its meanings – what are its aesthetic allegiances and precedents? How do institutional structures, political currents and popular trends inform the significance of aesthetic work? What is the role of patrons? Who are the curators? What use is the canon?",

The information and skills learned in this course will enable students to take an interdisciplinary approach to an emerging and complex set of problems which medical professionals themselves are not currently being trained to deal with. To this end, the course requires each student to do a research project on a specific problem arising from a paradox inherent in contemporary Western medicine: while knowledge of traditional medical terminology is still required for medical professionals (in fact, its use is ever-expanding), it is now being used by a third and even fourth generation of people who don't understand the word-parts and principles on which this terminology is based. More pragmatically, the course will prepare students to take a lead in dealing with this new and poorly understood category of potential medical error: those which arise from failures of accurate communication between health care professionals, failures with potentially serious consequences to health care in general, and to patients in particular.",

By studying how humans impacted their environments in the past, we gain a better appreciation of the potential effects of our own activities and their environmental consequences. Many of the processes affecting the planet today are rooted in our past, as many of the actions we see today were produced by and had impacts upon past societies. Similarly, past societies were forced to deal with the effects of climate change, a problem with which our current society is struggling. A better understanding of how these situations arose in the past may help us to better discern general principles that continue to operate today, and thus plan toward our future.",
